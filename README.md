# Customer-Data-Analysis-for-E-commerce-Company
This project involves analyzing the customer dataset of an e-commerce company based in New York City that specializes in selling clothing online. In addition to their online offerings, the company provides in-store style consultations with personal stylists. Customers can engage in these sessions and subsequently place orders through the mobile app or website.

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the data to assist the company in deciding whether to prioritize enhancements to their mobile app experience or their website, and also to create a machine learning model that can predict the yearly amount spent by a customer based on the customer's data.
